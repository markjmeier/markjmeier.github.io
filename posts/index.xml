      <description>The intent of this site is to give myself some type of personal/professional presence out of the web. It&amp;rsquo;s been long overdue and something I always kept on a backburner.
I&amp;rsquo;ll add posts on occasion, but I don&amp;rsquo;t suspect it will be very frequent nor regularly. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably write about running, hiking, and a little bit of my experiences working in tech and growing the customer side of a tech company.</description>
